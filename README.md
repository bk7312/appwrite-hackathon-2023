# TownSquare, an Appwrite Hackathon Project
 
TownSquare is an open-source forum designed using React and Tailwind CSS on the front-end, Appwrite Cloud on the back-end, and deployed using Vercel. It offers an online community for any small town or village to deploy so they can keep up-to-date with the latest happenings in town.

It is mostly made for fun and to learn web development, and also to participate in the [Appwrite Hackathon 2023](https://hashnode.com/hackathons/appwrite). Currently, it is still mostly a demo app. If you need a polished/professional forum software, I would highly recommend [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) instead.
